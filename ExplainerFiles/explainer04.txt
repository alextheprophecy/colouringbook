   - Allow users to choose a theme or enter their own if they have a unique idea.

2. **Style and Theme Validation:**
   - After selecting a theme, generate a sample page in that style to give the user an idea of what their coloring book will look like.

3. **Modify and Regenerate:**
   - Provide options to modify the theme or regenerate a new sample based on the user’s preferences.
