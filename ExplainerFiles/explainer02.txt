Feature Focus: Initial Greeting and Mode Selection in Creation Chat Screen

Objective:
Implement the logic for the initial interaction between Sketchy and the user on the creation chat screen, where Sketchy introduces itself and asks the user to choose between "Story Mode" or "Theme Mode."

Requirements:
1. **Greeting Message:** Display a welcoming message from Sketchy as soon as the user accesses the creation chat screen.
2. **Mode Selection Options:** Present two clear options for the user:
   - **Story Mode:** Directs the user to a series of prompts to build a story-based coloring book.
   - **Theme Mode:** Allows the user to select a predefined theme for their coloring book.
3. **User Interaction:**
   - Add a conversational touch by implementing a typewriter effect to make Sketchy's text appear letter by letter.
   - Ensure that once the greeting is complete, the mode selection options appear smoothly on the screen.

Visual Elements:
- A friendly illustration of Sketchy positioned next to the chat text for a more engaging experience.
- Clear, child-friendly buttons or cards for selecting between "Story Mode" and "Theme Mode."
