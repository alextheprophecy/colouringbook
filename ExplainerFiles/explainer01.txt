Project Name: Sketchy's Coloring Book Creator

Objective:
The goal is to complete the remaining functionality of the frontend's creation chat screen where children interact with Sketchy, the AI mascot, to build their coloring books. The Node.js backend and the rest of the frontend have already been developed, so the focus is solely on the creation chat component.

Scope:
1. **Interactive Mascot (Sketchy):** Implement Sketchy as a friendly, conversational guide who interacts with users to help them create their coloring books.
2. **Story Mode:** Guide users through creating a coloring book by developing a narrative with characters and scenes.
3. **Theme Mode:** Allow users to choose a specific theme for their coloring book and generate themed pages.
4. **Modify and Regenerate:** Provide options for users to critique generated pages and make modifications or regenerate them as needed.
5. **Dynamic UI Updates:** Ensure smooth, engaging transitions between states and scenes in the creation chat area.

6. **Sketchy Mascot Integration:** Implement Sketchy as the visual mascot for the creation chat screen. The image file for Sketchy (sketchy_mascot.png) is located in the public/assets/textures directory. This friendly AI character should be prominently displayed alongside the chat messages to create a more engaging and personalized experience for young users.

Key points for Sketchy integration:
- Use the image file: public/assets/textures/sketchy_mascot.png
- Position Sketchy next to or above the chat messages
- Ensure Sketchy's presence is consistent throughout the creation process

Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js is used for implementing the user interaction area.
- **Backend:** Node.js backend is already fully functional, ignore for now
