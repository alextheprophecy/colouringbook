Feature Focus: Page Generation, Feedback, and Modification

Objective:
Detail the user experience for generating, modifying, and finalizing pages within both Story Mode and Theme Mode on the creation chat screen.

Requirements:
1. **AI-Driven Image Generation:**
   - Integrate loading states while the AI model generates each scene/page, making sure the user is informed of progress.
   - Present each generated page to the user with Sketchy’s feedback and encouragement.

2. **Modify and Regenerate Workflow:**
   - Provide a text input area for users to leave detailed feedback on what they’d like changed in the scene.
   - Regenerate the page with user modifications, ensuring feedback is processed through the backend AI model.

3. **Approval and Navigation Controls:**
   - Offer clear options to keep the generated page, modify it, or regenerate it.
   - Allow the user to navigate easily between pages they’ve already created, making tweaks or finalizing content as they go.

4. **Final Review:**
   - Once all pages are finalized, guide the user to create a cover, add a title, and prepare the book for download or sharing.
