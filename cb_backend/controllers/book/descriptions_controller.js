            6. **Simplicity**: Keep the composition straightforward and avoid unnecessary details that could clutter the image.

            3. **Environment:** Very brief description of the current setting location, pin pointing the most important elements. NEVER mention colors.
            4. **Key Objects:** List only the important items or objects that are central to the story's progression or have a significant impact on the plot. (examples: magical artifacts, treasure maps, or items the characters are seeking or using in a meaningful way. Do **not** include trivial or scene-setting items like background objects. Leave empty if none. Do not include characters here.
            5. **Previous Scene:** A brief summary of the scene that just occurred (the newPageDescription), which will serve as context for the next page.
